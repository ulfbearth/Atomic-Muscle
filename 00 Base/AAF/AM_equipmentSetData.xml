Add or remove unEquip and reEquip entries to control which slots get
equipped or unequipped before and after animations.

Use the exact slot names defined here: https://www.creationkit.com/fallout4/index.php?title=Biped_Slots

For the slots with repeated names like "Unnamed" and "Possibly Weapons"
add a number after each. So, "Unnamed1" is slot index 24 and "Possibly Weapons2"
is slot index 33.
